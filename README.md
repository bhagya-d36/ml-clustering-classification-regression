# Machine Learning Project

This task was done as part of a university project and explores **three real-world datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository** using both **unsupervised** and **supervised** learning techniques.  
The goal was to formulate research questions, build predictive models, compare algorithm performance, and contextualize findings with existing literature.

## 📊 Datasets
- Three datasets selected from the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).  
- Each dataset covers different domains to ensure diverse analysis.  
- Preprocessing steps applied: cleaning, normalization, handling missing values/outliers, feature engineering, and more.

## 🧠 Methods
### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning
- **Clustering (K-Means)**  
- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**  

### 🔹 Supervised Learning
- **Regression**
- **Classification**
